            <h6>Hey! My name is Jon and I am a 29 year old Professional eSports gamer turned Sofware Developer out of Southern California.
                 I have been programming for around 2 years now and I love how much there is to learn and how many ways there are to solve problems and create!
                  Some of my other interests outside of programming are competitve gaming , coaching youth basketball, and anything science related.
                   But really the one thing I want people to know about me is how much I love learning and improving in things I do in life.
